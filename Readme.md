Great! Youâ€™ve shared two Assembly language programs. Iâ€™ll explain both line by line in a simple, beginner-friendly way (as if you're 17 years old and just starting with Assembly).

## ðŸ§  **Program 1: Add Two Numbers and Store Result + Carry**

ðŸ“œ **Filename: IMG-20250801-WA0010.jpg**

```asm
DATA SEGMENT
  N1 DW 0050H      ; N1 is a 16-bit variable with value 50h (hex) = 80 (decimal)
  N2 DW 00F0H      ; N2 = F0h = 240 decimal
  N3 DW ?          ; N3 is uninitialized, will store the result
  N4 DW ?          ; N4 is uninitialized, will store carry if any
DATA ENDS
```

* **DW** = Define Word (16-bit)
* `?` means uninitialized
* We're reserving space for storing data.

```asm
CODE SEGMENT
ASSUME CS:CODE, DS:DATA
```

* We're telling the assembler to treat `CS` (Code Segment) and `DS` (Data Segment) accordingly.

---

### ðŸš€ Start of Program

```asm
START:
MOV AX, DATA     ; Move address of DATA segment into AX
MOV DS, AX       ; Load that address into DS register (needed to access variables)
```

> You **must load the segment address into DS** before accessing variables like `N1`.

```asm
XOR AX, AX       ; AX = 0 (clears AX register)
MOV BX, AX       ; BX = 0 (clears BX register, used for carry)
MOV AX, N1       ; AX = N1 (load first number)
ADD AX, N2       ; AX = AX + N2 (adds second number)
JNC STOP         ; Jump to STOP if there is NO Carry
INC BX           ; If Carry happened, increase BX (BX = 1)
MOV N4, BX       ; Store BX (carry info) into N4
```

* **JNC** = Jump if No Carry. If there's a carry (e.g., sum > 0xFFFF), it skips `INC BX`.

```asm
STOP:
MOV N3, AX       ; Store the result of addition in N3
MOV AH, 4CH      ; Exit function for DOS interrupt
INT 21H          ; Call DOS to exit program
```

> âœ… This program adds two numbers, stores result in `N3`, and carry (if any) in `N4`.

---

## âœ… Output for Program 1:

* N1 = 80
* N2 = 240
* N1 + N2 = 320 â†’ 0x0140 â†’ No carry, so:

  * N3 = 0140h
  * N4 = 0000h

---

## ðŸ“œ **Program 2: Display "Hello World!"**

ðŸ“œ **Filename: IMG-20250801-WA0007.jpg**

```asm
D SEGMENT
STRING DB 'Hello World!$'
D ENDS
```

* A string is defined with **\$** at the end (for DOS to know where to stop printing).
* `DB` = Define Byte

---

```asm
C SEGMENT
ASSUME CS:C, DS:D
START:
MOV AX,D      ; Load address of data segment (D) into AX
MOV DS,AX     ; Move it to DS so we can access STRING
LEA DX,STRING ; Load address of STRING into DX register
```

> `LEA` = Load Effective Address (used for strings/pointers)

```asm
MOV AH,9      ; DOS function 9 (to display a string)
INT 21H       ; Call DOS interrupt to print string
```

> This will print: **Hello World!**

```asm
MOV AH,4CH    ; DOS function to exit
INT 21H       ; Exit program
```

---

## âœ… Output for Program 2:

```
Hello World!
```

ðŸ’¡ The `$` at the end of the string tells DOS where to stop printing. It won't print `$` itself.

---

## Let me simplify the **concepts** for you:

| Term         | What it does                              |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `MOV`        | Copy value from one place to another      |
| `XOR AX, AX` | A trick to set AX = 0                     |
| `JNC`        | Jump if thereâ€™s No Carry (from addition)  |
| `INT 21H`    | A DOS interrupt (used to print/exit/etc.) |
| `DW`         | Define a 16-bit number                    |
| `DB`         | Define a Byte (for characters or strings) |
| `LEA`        | Used to get the address of a variable     |
