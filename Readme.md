Alright, let‚Äôs go step-by-step and break down these **three programs** like I‚Äôm explaining to a 7-year-old.

---

## **Program 1 ‚Äì Adding Two Large Numbers**

(First image)

### Purpose:

This program adds two big numbers (each number is stored in two parts because registers can only hold small pieces at a time).

### Step-by-step:

```
DATA SEGMENT
NUM1 DW 1234H,5678H
NUM2 DW 0AB12H,0CDEFH
RESULT DW 3 DUP(?)
```

* **DATA SEGMENT** ‚Üí We are telling the computer, ‚ÄúHere is the storage box for our numbers.‚Äù
* **NUM1** ‚Üí First big number: first half = `1234H`, second half = `5678H`.
* **NUM2** ‚Üí Second big number: first half = `AB12H`, second half = `CDEFH`.
* **RESULT** ‚Üí A box to store the answer. `3 DUP(?)` means make 3 empty spots.

---

```
CODE SEGMENT
ASSUME CS:CODE, DS:DATA
```

* We say: **CS** (Code Segment) will use `CODE` and **DS** (Data Segment) will use `DATA`.

---

```
MOV AX,DATA
MOV DS,AX
```

* Put the **address of DATA** into DS (so DS can find our numbers).

```
MOV DX,00H
```

* DX will store carry from addition. Start with `0`.

---

```
MOV AX,NUM1
MOV BX,NUM2
CLC
ADD AX,BX
MOV RESULT,AX
```

* Load **first halves** of numbers into AX and BX.
* **CLC** means "clear carry".
* Add them ‚Üí store in RESULT.

---

```
MOV AX,NUM1+2
MOV BX,NUM2+2
ADC AX,BX
MOV RESULT+2,AX
```

* Load **second halves** of numbers.
* **ADC** = Add with Carry (if the first addition had overflow).
* Store result in RESULT+2 (next part of memory).

---

```
ADDC DX,00H
MOV RESULT+4,DX
```

* Save final carry into RESULT+4.

---

```
MOV AH,4CH
INT 21H
```

* End program and return to DOS.

üìå **Summary**: It adds two big numbers (4 bytes each) and stores result in 6 bytes.

---

## **Program 2 ‚Äì Subtracting Two Large Numbers**

(Second image)

This one is just like Program 1 but instead of **ADD** it uses **SUB**.

---

```
DATA SEGMENT
NUM2 DW 1234H,5678H
NUM1 DW 0AB12H,0CDEFH
RESULT DW 3 DUP(?)
```

* NUM2 is the first number, NUM1 is the second.
* We will do NUM2 - NUM1.

---

```
MOV AX,NUM1
MOV BX,NUM2
CLC
SUB AX,BX
MOV RESULT,AX
```

* First halves ‚Üí Subtract BX from AX ‚Üí store.

---

```
MOV AX,NUM1+2
MOV BX,NUM2+2
SBB AX,BX
MOV RESULT+2,AX
```

* Second halves ‚Üí Subtract with borrow (SBB).

---

```
SBB DX,00H
MOV RESULT+4,DX
```

* Store final borrow into last part.

üìå **Summary**: It subtracts two large numbers using SUB and SBB.

---

## **Program 3 ‚Äì Printing Two Messages**

(Third image)

This one is simpler ‚Äî it just prints two words.

---

```
DATA SEGMENT
MSG1 DB "HELLO$"
MSG2 DB "WORLD$"
DATA ENDS
```

* MSG1 = "HELLO\$"
* MSG2 = "WORLD\$"
* `$` means ‚Äúend of text‚Äù for DOS.

---

```
MOV AX,DATA
MOV DS,AX
```

* Load the address of DATA into DS.

---

```
LEA DX,MSG1
MOV AH,09H
INT 21H
```

* **LEA DX,MSG1** ‚Üí Put the starting address of MSG1 into DX.
* AH = 09H means ‚Äúprint string‚Äù.
* INT 21H calls DOS to print "HELLO".

---

```
LEA DX,MSG2
MOV AH,09H
INT 21H
```

* Same thing for "WORLD".

---

```
MOV AH,4CH
INT 21H
```

* End the program.

üìå **Summary**: Prints ‚ÄúHELLO‚Äù and ‚ÄúWORLD‚Äù one after another.

---

If you want, I can **draw diagrams** showing memory layout for these programs so you can visualize how numbers and strings are stored. That will make them super easy to understand.

You're learning 8086 Assembly Language! Great step for low-level understanding of computers. I'll **explain each of your 3 programs line by line** as a beginner-friendly guide.


---

## ‚úÖ **PROGRAM 1 ‚Äî PRINT "HELLO WORLD!"**

### üî∑ CODE:

```asm
PROGRAM 
D SEGMENT 
STRING DB 'HELLO WORLD!$' 
D ENDS 
C SEGMENT 
ASSUME CS:C, DS:D 
START: 
MOV AX,D 
MOV DS,AX 
LEA DX,STRING 
MOV AH,09H 
INT 21H 
MOV AH,4CH 
INT 21H 
C ENDS 
END START 
```

### üî∑ OUTPUT:

```
HELLO WORLD!
```

---

### üß† **Explanation:**

* `PROGRAM` ‚Äî Label for the program (optional).
* `D SEGMENT` ‚Äî Define **Data Segment** (`D`), where we store variables/data.
* `STRING DB 'HELLO WORLD!$'` ‚Äî Create a string constant that ends with `$` (DOS needs `$` to know where the string ends).
* `D ENDS` ‚Äî End of Data Segment.

---

### ‚ñ∂ CODE Segment (Executable Instructions):

* `C SEGMENT` ‚Äî Define Code Segment.
* `ASSUME CS:C, DS:D` ‚Äî Tell assembler that:

  * `CS` (Code Segment) = `C`
  * `DS` (Data Segment) = `D`

---

### ‚ñ∂ Execution begins at `START:` label:

* `MOV AX,D` ‚Äî Move address of Data Segment `D` to AX register.
* `MOV DS,AX` ‚Äî Set DS register to point to data segment.
* `LEA DX,STRING` ‚Äî Load the address of the string into DX.
* `MOV AH,09H` ‚Äî Tell DOS that you want to print a string (`09H` is print service).
* `INT 21H` ‚Äî Call DOS interrupt to do the print.
* `MOV AH,4CH` ‚Äî Tell DOS you want to exit the program.
* `INT 21H` ‚Äî Exit the program.
* `C ENDS` / `END START` ‚Äî Marks end of code and where execution begins.

---

## ‚úÖ **PROGRAM 2 ‚Äî ADDITION with CARRY DETECTION**

```asm
DATA SEGMENT 
N1 DW 0050H 
N2 DW 00F0H 
N3 DW ? 
N4 DW ? 
DATA ENDS 
```

### ‚ûï Two numbers to add:

* `N1 = 0050H (80)`
* `N2 = 00F0H (240)`
* `N3` will hold **sum**
* `N4` will hold **carry (BX)**

---

### üß† **Code Explanation:**

```asm
CODE SEGMENT 
ASSUME CS:CODE,DS:DATA 
START: 
MOV AX,DATA      ; Load address of data segment
MOV DS,AX        ; Set data segment
XOR AX,AX        ; Clear AX = 0
MOV BX,AX        ; Clear BX = 0
MOV AX,N1        ; AX = N1 = 0050H
ADD AX,N2        ; AX = AX + N2 = 0050 + 00F0 = 0140H
JNC STOP         ; If NO carry, jump to STOP
INC BX           ; If carry occurred, increment BX
MOV N4,BX        ; Store carry (0 or 1) to N4
STOP: 
MOV N3,AX        ; Store result (sum) to N3
MOV AH,4CH       ; Exit program
INT 21H 
CODE ENDS 
END START 
```

### üì§ **OUTPUT:**

* `N1 = 0050H = 80`
* `N2 = 00F0H = 240`
* `N3 = 0140H = 320`
* `N4 = 0` (no carry occurred since sum < 0xFFFF)

---

## ‚úÖ **PROGRAM 3 ‚Äî SUBTRACTION with BORROW DETECTION**

```asm
DATA SEGMENT 
N1 DW 00F0H 
N2 DW 0050H 
N3 DW ? 
N4 DW ? 
DATA ENDS 
```

### ‚ûñ Two numbers to subtract:

* `N1 = 00F0H (240)`
* `N2 = 0050H (80)`
* `N3` will hold result
* `N4` will hold borrow flag (BX)

---

### üß† **Code Explanation:**

```asm
CODE SEGMENT 
ASSUME CS:CODE, DS:DATA 
START: 
MOV AX, DATA     ; Load address of data segment
MOV DS, AX       ; Set DS
XOR AX, AX       ; Clear AX
XOR BX, BX       ; Clear BX
MOV AX, N1       ; AX = N1 = 00F0
SUB AX, N2       ; AX = AX - N2 = 00F0 - 0050 = 00A0
JNC NO_BORROW    ; Jump if no borrow
INC BX           ; If borrow occurred, BX++
NO_BORROW: 
MOV N4, BX       ; Store borrow status in N4
MOV N3, AX       ; Store result in N3
MOV AH, 4CH      ; Exit
INT 21H 
CODE ENDS 
END START 
```

### üì§ **OUTPUT:**

* `N3 = 00A0H (160)`
* `N4 = 0` (no borrow occurred)
